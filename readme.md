Unwired Android Library Demo
============================

 

To get the app to work, you'll need to:

-   Add the library file  - `locationapi.aar` - we sent you on email to the
    `/locationapi/` folder

-   Add your developer token to `mToken` in
    `/app/src/main/java/com/unwiredlabs/unwireddemo/MainActivity.java`

-   Add your Google Maps API token to
    `/app/src/release/res/values/google_maps_api.xml`

 

Do file a bug report if something isn't right!
